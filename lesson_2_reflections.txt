Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A1: When you intialize a repository, you create a subdirectory that contains all of your repository files such as your commits.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A2: The staging area is simply a place to place files before committing them into the repository. The working directory is a place for all of the files to exist in the directory before being moved to a staging area or repository.
